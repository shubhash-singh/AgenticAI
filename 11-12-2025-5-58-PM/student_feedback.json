    "The title and introductory sentence clearly state the simulation is about thermal equilibrium and heat flow.",
    "The visual layout is clean and organized, making it easy to find different sections."
  ],
  "visual": [
    "The SVG visualization is generally clear with distinct objects and temperature indicators.",
    "The temperature bars could be more explicitly linked to the thermometer's scale for better direct comparison."
  ],
  "controls": [
    "The sliders are easy to drag and adjust on a mobile screen.",
    "The labels for the sliders are clear and easy to read."
  ],
  "explanations": [
    "The collapsible sections provide good, concise explanations of the concepts.",
    "No confusion found in the explanations; they are easy to follow."

  "bugs_or_issues": [
    "When dragging the thermometer, it occasionally snaps back to the center if I release it too quickly or outside a specific range."
  ],
  "suggestions": [
    "Add a visual cue or line connecting the thermometer's temperature reading to the current temperature of Object A or B when it's hovering over them.",
    "Make the heat flow arrows slightly thicker or more pronounced to be more visible on smaller screens."
