  "detail": "A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon, orbiting the Earth, comes directly between the Sun and the Earth. During this alignment, the Moon blocks the light from the Sun, casting a shadow on a portion of the Earth. This phenomenon is only visible from the areas on Earth that fall within the Moon's shadow.",
  "working": "1. **Alignment:** The Sun, Moon, and Earth line up in that specific order.\n2. **Moon's Orbit:** The Moon is continuously orbiting the Earth.\n3. **Shadow Casting:** When the Moon is between the Sun and Earth, it obstructs the Sun's rays.\n4. **Earth's Position:** A part of the Earth experiences darkness as the Moon's shadow falls on it.",
  "intuition_logical_flow": "Imagine you are holding a ball (the Moon) between a light bulb (the Sun) and a wall (the Earth). If you move the ball directly in front of the light bulb, it will cast a shadow on the wall. Similarly, when the Moon gets directly between the Sun and Earth, it blocks the Sun's light and creates a shadow on Earth, which we call a solar eclipse.",
