  "concept": "Earth's Revolution",
  "description": "Earth's Revolution is the journey the Earth takes around the Sun. Imagine Earth as a runner on a circular track, and the Sun is at the center of that track. The Earth continuously moves around the Sun in this path.",
  "key_topics_from_the_textbook": [
    "Earth revolves around the Sun.",
    "The time taken for one complete revolution is approximately 365.25 days.",
    "This period is considered one year.",
    "The extra 0.25 days are accounted for by adding one extra day every four years, which is a leap year (February has 29 days).",
    "Revolution causes seasons.",
    "The Earth is tilted on its axis."
  ],
  "detail": "The Earth doesn't just spin on its own axis (that's rotation, which causes day and night). It also travels in a large, slightly oval-shaped path around the Sun. This path is called its orbit. One full trip around the Sun takes about 365 and a quarter days. We call this period a year. To make things neat, we usually round this to 365 days. But what about that extra quarter of a day? Every four years, these quarter days add up to a full day. This extra day is added to February, making it 29 days long, and that year is called a leap year.",
  "working": "1. **The Orbit:** The Earth follows a specific path, its orbit, around the Sun. This orbit is almost a circle but is slightly stretched, making it an ellipse.\n2. **The Journey:** The Earth continuously moves along this orbit, completing one full circle around the Sun.\n3. **The Time:** This complete journey takes approximately 365.25 days.\n4. **Accounting for the Quarter:** The 0.25 (a quarter) of a day accumulates. Every four years, these accumulate to a full day (0.25 x 4 = 1). This is why we have leap years with 366 days.\n5. **The Tilt:** Crucially, the Earth's axis is tilted at an angle of about 23.5 degrees. This tilt, combined with the revolution around the Sun, is what causes the different seasons. As Earth orbits, different parts of the planet are tilted towards or away from the Sun at different times of the year, receiving more or less direct sunlight.",
  "intuition_logical_flow": "Think of it like this: You are walking around a campfire. You are rotating (spinning on your own feet) and you are also revolving (walking in a circle around the campfire). The Earth does both! The revolution around the Sun is a much bigger journey, and it takes a whole year. The tilt of the Earth is like holding a slightly tilted lamp while you walk around a central light source – sometimes the top of the lamp gets more light, and sometimes the bottom does.",

  "relation_between_sub_concepts": "Earth's revolution is directly linked to the concept of a \"year\" and the occurrence of \"leap years.\" The time taken for one complete revolution defines the length of our year. The slight difference between 365 days and the actual revolution time leads to the concept of leap years. Furthermore, the revolution, when combined with the Earth's axial tilt, is the fundamental cause of \"seasons.\"",
