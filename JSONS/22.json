  "detail": "During a lunar eclipse, the Earth acts like a giant screen that blocks sunlight from reaching the Moon. The Earth has two types of shadows:\n* **Umbra:** The darkest, central part of the shadow where the Sun is completely blocked.\n* **Penumbra:** The lighter, outer part of the shadow where the Sun is only partially blocked.\n\nA lunar eclipse can happen only when the Moon is full. This is because only during a full moon is the Moon on the opposite side of the Earth from the Sun.",
  "working": "1. **Alignment:** The Sun, Earth, and Moon line up in a straight line, with the Earth in the middle.\n2. **Shadow Casting:** The Earth, being opaque, blocks the sunlight from reaching the Moon.\n3. **Moon in Shadow:** As the Moon moves into the Earth's shadow, less sunlight falls on it.\n4. **Visible Changes:** Depending on how much of the Moon enters the Earth's shadow (umbra or penumbra), the Moon appears to dim, change color, or become completely hidden for a short period.",
  "intuition_logical_flow": "Imagine you are holding a ball (the Earth) between a flashlight (the Sun) and a wall (the Moon). When the ball is directly in line with the flashlight and the wall, it casts a shadow on the wall. Similarly, when the Earth is between the Sun and the Moon, it casts its shadow on the Moon.",

A lunar eclipse happens *only* when this alignment is such that the Earth is in the middle, casting its shadow on the Moon.
