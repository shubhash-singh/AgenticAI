  "detail": "The Earth is tilted on its axis at an angle of 66.5 degrees. This tilt is always in the same direction as the Earth orbits the Sun. When one hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun, it receives more direct sunlight and experiences summer. At the same time, the other hemisphere is tilted away from the Sun, receiving less direct sunlight, and experiences winter.\n\nThe Earth's revolution around the Sun, combined with its tilt, causes distinct changes throughout the year, leading to the four main seasons: summer, autumn (fall), winter, and spring.\n\n* **Summer Solstice:** This is the longest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere, occurring around June 21st. The Northern Hemisphere is maximally tilted towards the Sun, receiving the most direct sunlight. The Southern Hemisphere experiences its shortest day and winter solstice.\n* **Winter Solstice:** This is the shortest day of the year in the Northern Hemisphere, occurring around December 22nd. The Northern Hemisphere is maximally tilted away from the Sun. The Southern Hemisphere experiences its longest day and summer solstice.\n* **Equinoxes:** Twice a year, around March 20th (Vernal Equinox) and September 22nd (Autumnal Equinox), the Earth's axis is neither tilted towards nor away from the Sun. This results in roughly equal amounts of daylight and darkness across the globe.",
  "working": "1. **Earth's Tilt:** Imagine the Earth as a spinning top that is not standing straight up and down but is leaning over at an angle. This lean is called its tilt.\n2. **Revolution Around the Sun:** The Earth travels in a large oval path around the Sun.\n3. **Combined Effect:** As the Earth travels around the Sun, its tilt remains constant. This means that at different points in its orbit, different parts of the Earth will lean *towards* or *away* from the Sun.\n4. **Direct vs. Indirect Sunlight:** When a part of the Earth leans towards the Sun, it gets more direct rays, making it warmer (summer). When it leans away, the Sun's rays hit it at a slant, spreading out the heat and making it cooler (winter).\n5. **Hemispheres:** The Earth is divided into two halves by the Equator: the Northern Hemisphere and the Southern Hemisphere. When the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun, the Southern Hemisphere is tilted away, and vice-versa.",
  "intuition_logical_flow": "Think of a flashlight (the Sun) and a tilted ball (the Earth). If you shine the flashlight directly onto the ball, that spot gets a lot of concentrated light and heat. If you shine it at an angle, the light spreads out over a larger area and is less intense. The Earth's tilt means different parts of the ball get the direct beam at different times of its \"year\" (orbit).",
