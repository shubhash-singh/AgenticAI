    "Earth's rotation",
    "Axis of rotation",

  "detail": "Our Earth is not still; it's always moving. One of its main movements is rotation. Imagine the Earth is like a giant ball that's spinning. It spins on an imaginary line that goes through the North Pole and the South Pole. This imaginary line is called the **axis of rotation**. The Earth takes approximately 24 hours to complete one full spin on its axis.",
  "working": "The Earth rotates from west to east. As the Earth spins, different parts of its surface face the Sun at different times. When a part of the Earth faces the Sun, it receives sunlight and experiences **daytime**. As the Earth continues to rotate, that part turns away from the Sun, and it becomes dark, experiencing **nighttime**. This continuous spinning makes sure that we have a cycle of day and night.",
  "intuition_logical_flow": "Think about spinning yourself around in a chair. As you spin, different parts of the room come into your view and then disappear as you turn away from them. Similarly, as the Earth spins, the Sun, which appears to move across the sky, actually stays relatively still, and it's our Earth's rotation that makes the Sun appear to rise in the east and set in the west.",
