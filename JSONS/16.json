  "concept": "Day and Night Cycle",
  "description": "Day and night happen because the Earth spins around. As it spins, different parts of the Earth face the Sun, which makes it daytime, and then face away from the Sun, which makes it nighttime. This spinning is a continuous process, creating a cycle of day and night.",
  "key_topics_from_the_textbook": [
    "Rotation of the Earth",
    "Earth's movement around the Sun"
  ],
  "detail": "The **Day and Night Cycle** is a fundamental phenomenon on Earth. It is caused by the Earth's continuous spinning on its axis, an imaginary line passing through the North and South Poles. This spinning is called **rotation**. As the Earth rotates, one side faces the Sun, receiving sunlight and experiencing **daytime**. Simultaneously, the opposite side faces away from the Sun, and it is dark, experiencing **nighttime**. The Earth completes one full rotation in approximately 24 hours, which is why we have a day and a night cycle every 24 hours.",
  "working": "1. **Earth's Rotation:** The Earth is constantly spinning around its axis. Imagine a toy top spinning.\n2. **Sunlight:** The Sun is a star that emits light.\n3. **Facing the Sun:** As the Earth rotates, a particular spot on its surface will eventually face the Sun. When it faces the Sun, it gets illuminated by sunlight, and we call this **daytime**.\n4. **Facing Away from the Sun:** As the Earth continues to spin, that same spot will move away from the Sun. When it is no longer facing the Sun, it will be in darkness, and we call this **nighttime**.\n5. **Continuous Cycle:** This process repeats continuously as the Earth keeps rotating, leading to the regular occurrence of day and night.",
  "intuition_logical_flow": "Think of a ball and a torchlight. If you shine the torchlight on the ball and then slowly spin the ball, you'll see that one side of the ball is always lit (day), and the other side is always dark (night). As you spin it, different parts of the ball move into the light and then into the darkness. The Earth is like the ball, and the Sun is like the torchlight. The Earth spinning is what causes day and night.",
