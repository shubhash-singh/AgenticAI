      "options": [
        "A) A clear glass window",
        "B) A thin sheet of paper",

      "question": "You are standing in a park and notice your shadow. As the Sun rises higher in the sky, what happens to the length of your shadow?",
      "type": "mcq",
      "options": [
        "A) It gets longer",
        "B) It gets shorter",

      "question": "A pin\u2011hole camera forms an image because:",
      "type": "mcq",
      "options": [
        "A) Light bounces off the object and enters the camera.",
        "B) Light travels in straight lines and passes through the tiny hole.",
        "C) Light bends around the hole to create the picture.",
        "D) The camera itself emits light to form the image."

      "question": "Which statement best describes a translucent object?",
      "type": "mcq",
      "options": [
        "A) No light can pass through it.",
        "B) All light passes through it clearly.",
        "C) Some light passes through, but the image is blurred.",
        "D) It reflects all light like a mirror."

  "followups": [
    "Try making a simple pin\u2011hole camera at home using a cardboard box and a tiny pin.",
    "Observe your own shadow at different times of the day and draw its shape.",
    "Experiment with transparent, translucent, and opaque objects to see how each affects the light."
  ],
  "summary": "You learned how opaque objects block light to make shadows, why shadows change with the Sun's position, and how a pin\u2011hole camera uses straight\u2011line light travel to form images. Keep exploring light around you!"
