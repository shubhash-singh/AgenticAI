      "question": "Imagine you're holding a warm mug of cocoa. Where does the heat energy naturally travel?",

        "From your hands to the cocoa",
        "From the cocoa to your hands",
        "It stays within the cocoa",
        "It doesn't move at all"

      "hint": "Think about what feels warmer and what feels cooler. Heat tends to move from the warmer thing to the cooler thing.",

      "question": "If you place a cold spoon into a bowl of hot soup, what happens to the heat?",
      "type": "mcq",
      "options": [
        "Heat flows from the spoon to the soup.",
        "Heat flows from the soup to the spoon.",
        "Heat flows equally in both directions.",

      "hint": "Remember the natural direction of heat flow. It's like water flowing downhill!",

      "question": "Temperature is a way to measure:",

      "options": [
        "How much heat an object has.",
        "How fast heat is flowing.",
        "How hot or cold an object is.",

      "question": "When two objects with different temperatures are in contact, heat will flow until:",
      "type": "mcq",
      "options": [
        "The colder object becomes hotter than the first object.",
        "The hotter object cools down completely.",
        "Both objects reach the same temperature.",
        "Heat stops flowing completely, even if temperatures are different."

      "hint": "Think about what happens when things are balanced. Heat flow seeks a balance.",

  "followups": [
    "Great job understanding the basics of heat flow! Now, let's explore the different ways heat can move: conduction, convection, and radiation.",
    "Consider why wearing a sweater keeps you warm. How does that relate to the flow of heat?"
  ],
  "summary": "Heat is a form of energy that always flows from a hotter object or region to a colder one. This movement continues until thermal equilibrium is reached, meaning both reach the same temperature."
