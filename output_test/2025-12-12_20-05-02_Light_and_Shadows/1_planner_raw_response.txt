    "Differentiate between opaque, transparent, and translucent objects based on their interaction with light.",
    "Explain the working principle of a pin-hole camera using the concept of straight-line propagation of light.",
    "Predict how the position of a light source affects the size and shape of a shadow.",
    "Apply knowledge of light and shadows to real-life examples like sundials and shadow puppets."

  "key_concepts": [
    "Light travels in straight lines",
    "Opaque objects block light and form shadows",

  "variables_to_simulate": [
    "Position of light source (Sun or torch)",
    "Type of object (opaque, transparent, translucent)",
    "Distance between object and light source",
    "Size and shape of the shadow formed"
  ],
  "user_interactions": [
    "Drag light source to change its position",
    "Select object type from dropdown menu",
    "Move object closer or farther from light source using slider",
    "Toggle between different object shapes (circle, square, triangle)"

  "simulation_logic": [
    "Start with default setup: Sun as light source, opaque object, and surface for shadow",
    "When user drags light source, update shadow position and size in real-time",
    "If user selects transparent object, show no shadow formation",
    "If user selects translucent object, show faint or blurred shadow",
    "When object is moved closer to light source, increase shadow size; when moved away, decrease shadow size",
    "Update pin-hole camera view when user toggles camera mode, showing inverted image due to straight-line light travel"

  "mobile_ui_plan": [
    "Top section: Light source (Sun/torch) that can be dragged horizontally",

  "misconceptions_to_address": [
    "Shadows are always completely black - they can be gray depending on ambient light",
    "Transparent objects form clear shadows - they don't form shadows at all",
    "Shadows change shape randomly - they maintain the silhouette of the object blocking light",
    "Pin-hole cameras work by bending light - they work because light travels in straight lines"

  "text_instructions_for_students": [
    "Drag the Sun or torch to see how shadow position changes",

    "Move the object closer and farther to observe shadow size changes",
    "Switch to pin-hole camera mode to see how images are formed",
