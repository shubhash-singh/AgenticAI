    "3. Calculate Heat Flow Rate: Heat_Flow_Rate is proportional to the temperature difference (e.g., Rate = k * |Temp_A - Temp_B|, where k is a constant).",
    "4. Update Temperatures: In each time step, decrease the temperature of the hotter object and increase the temperature of the colder object by Heat_Flow_Rate * deltaTime.",
    "5. Check for Thermal Equilibrium: If Temperature_Object_A is approximately equal to Temperature_Object_B, stop the simulation and indicate thermal equilibrium.",
    "6. Display Updates: Visually represent the temperatures of Object A and Object B, and an indicator for the direction and intensity of heat flow."
