      "question": "Imagine you have a super hot mug of cocoa (80\u00b0C) and a cold glass of water (20\u00b0C). Which way will the heat energy flow?",
      "type": "prediction",
      "options": [
        "Heat will flow from the cocoa to the water.",
        "Heat will flow from the water to the cocoa.",
        "Heat won't flow because they are different liquids.",
        "Heat will flow equally in both directions."
      ],
      "hint": "Think about what happens when you touch something hot. Does the heat come to you, or do you give heat away?",
      "correct_index": 0
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the main reason heat flows from one object to another?",
      "type": "mcq",
      "options": [
        "Because one object is bigger than the other.",
        "Because they are made of different materials.",
        "Because there is a difference in their temperature.",
        "Because one object is wet and the other is dry."
      ],
      "hint": "Heat is all about energy transfer due to a difference. What kind of difference drives this energy transfer?",
      "correct_index": 2
    },
    {
      "question": "When heat flows from a hotter object to a colder object, what happens to the temperature of the hotter object?",
      "type": "prediction",
      "options": [
        "Its temperature increases.",
        "Its temperature decreases.",
        "Its temperature stays the same.",
        "Its temperature becomes zero."
      ],
      "hint": "If a hot object is giving away energy, what happens to its 'hotness' level?",
      "correct_index": 1
    }
  ],
  "followups": [
    "Great job exploring heat flow! Remember, this movement of heat is what helps us understand so many things, from cooking to staying warm.",
    "Keep observing the world around you for examples of heat in action \u2013 you'll be surprised how often it appears!"
  ],
  "summary": "Heat is a form of energy that always moves from a hotter object to a colder object, driven by temperature differences."
