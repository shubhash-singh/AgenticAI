    "The 'Light Distance' slider label 'Light Distance (from object)' is slightly ambiguous. It should clarify if it's distance from the light source to the object, or the object's position on the stage relative to the light source.",
    "The pin-hole camera section is a conceptual representation. While it shows an inverted image, it might be beneficial to explain the underlying principle more explicitly in the text or a hint.",
    "The 'Measurement Noise' checkbox has no visible impact on the interactive elements, only on the recorded data. It would be beneficial to provide a visual cue or a clearer explanation of its effect.",
    "The calculation for umbra/penumbra ratio is a simplification. For educational purposes, a more detailed explanation or a clearer visual representation of the penumbra's formation would be helpful.",
    "The `resize` event listener for the SVG scene sets the `viewBox` dynamically which might interfere with the `preserveAspectRatio` setting if not handled carefully. Consider if this dynamic `viewBox` update is strictly necessary or if CSS scaling is sufficient.",
    "The `getSceneDimensions` function accounts for `BENCH_HEIGHT_PX` when calculating `sceneH` but the actual `sceneH` in calculations is based on `svgRect.height`, which includes the bench. This might lead to minor off-by-one calculations in vertical positioning relative to the SVG's defined coordinate system."
