        "B) Light travels in straight lines and passes through the pin-hole.",

  "summary": "Light travels in straight lines. Opaque objects block light to make shadows, transparent objects let light pass, and translucent ones scatter it. Pin-hole cameras use straight-line travel to capture inverted images!"
