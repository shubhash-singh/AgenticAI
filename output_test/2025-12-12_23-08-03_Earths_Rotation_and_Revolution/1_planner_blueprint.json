  "misconceptions_to_address": [
    "Earth is closer to Sun in summer (actually distance varies but isn't the main cause)",
    "Rotation causes seasons (actually it's revolution + tilt)",

  "text_instructions_for_students": [
    "Welcome! This simulation shows how Earth moves and why we have day/night and seasons.",
    "Use the sliders to explore: 1) How Earth spins (rotation), 2) How Earth orbits the Sun (revolution), 3) How Earth's tilt affects seasons.",
    "Try this: Set Earth to different positions around the Sun and see how the tilt changes which hemisphere gets more sunlight.",
    "Notice: When one hemisphere has summer, the other has winter because of the tilt!",
    "Experiment: Change the rotation speed to see how it affects day and night length.",
    "Remember: Day and night happen because Earth spins, while seasons happen because Earth orbits the Sun AND is tilted!"
