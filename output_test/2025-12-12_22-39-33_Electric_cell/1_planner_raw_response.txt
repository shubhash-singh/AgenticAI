  "text_instructions_for_students": "Welcome to the Electric Cell Simulation! Here, you can learn how a small power pack called an electric cell works. Use the switch to complete the circuit and see the bulb light up. Try changing the voltage and bulb type to see how it affects the brightness. Remember, the cell has a positive (+) and negative (-) end, and it converts stored chemical energy into the electricity that powers the bulb. Have fun exploring!",
