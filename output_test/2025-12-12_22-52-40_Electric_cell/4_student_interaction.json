  "followups": [
    "Try changing the cell orientation and see if the bulb still lights up.",

  "summary": "An electric cell converts chemical energy into electrical energy. It has a positive and negative terminal. When connected in a complete circuit, it makes a bulb light up. The orientation of the cell matters, and adding more cells can make the bulb brighter."
