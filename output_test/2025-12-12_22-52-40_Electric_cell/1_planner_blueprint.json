  "learning_objectives": [
    "Identify the parts of an electric cell (positive terminal, negative terminal, internal chemicals).",
    "Explain that an electric cell converts chemical energy into electrical energy to produce an electric current.",
    "Demonstrate how connecting a cell to a complete circuit allows a bulb to light up.",
    "Understand the role of the positive and negative terminals in the flow of electric current."
  ],
  "key_concepts": [
    "Electric cell as a source of electric current.",
    "Positive and negative terminals of a cell.",
    "Electric current as the flow of charges through a circuit.",
    "Conversion of chemical energy to electrical energy."
  ],
  "variables_to_simulate": [
    "Cell polarity (positive/negative terminal orientation)",
    "Circuit completeness (open/closed circuit)",
    "Number of cells in series (1 or 2 cells)",
    "Bulb condition (working or burnt out)"
  ],
  "user_interactions": [
    "Toggle switch to open/close the circuit",
    "Button to flip the cell orientation (swap terminals)",
    "Slider to add/remove a second cell (0 or 1 additional cell)",
    "Button to replace bulb (working/burnt out)"
  ],
  "simulation_logic": [
    "Initialize the simulation with a single electric cell, a bulb, and an open circuit.",
    "Display a clear diagram of the cell showing the positive (+) and negative (-) terminals.",
    "When the user closes the circuit (toggle switch), check the cell orientation and bulb condition.",
    "If the circuit is closed and the cell is correctly oriented, the bulb lights up (simulating current flow).",
    "If the user flips the cell orientation, the bulb remains off to show that current cannot flow without proper polarity.",
    "If the user adds a second cell, the bulb glows brighter (increased voltage), but only if the circuit is closed and correctly oriented.",
    "If the user selects a burnt-out bulb, the bulb remains off even if the circuit is closed and correctly oriented.",
    "Provide visual feedback (e.g., arrows showing charge flow) when the circuit is complete and the bulb is working."

  "misconceptions_to_address": [
    "Electric cells and batteries are the same thing.",

    "Try flipping the cell orientation and observe the effect.",
    "Add a second cell and see how it changes the brightness of the bulb.",
