    "1. **Initialization:** Display a light source, an opaque object, and a screen. The initial positions and intensities are set by default values.",
    "2. **Light Source Representation:** The light source emits rays represented as thin lines traveling outwards.",
    "3. **Object Interaction:** Based on `object_type`: ",
    "   - **Opaque:** Blocks all light rays. Rays hitting the object stop. A dark shadow area is formed on the screen.",
    "   - **Transparent:** Allows all light rays to pass through. No shadow is formed, or a very faint outline if there's a refractive index difference.",
    "   - **Translucent:** Allows some light rays to pass through, scattering them. A fuzzy or less defined shadow is formed.",
    "4. **Shadow Formation:** Light rays that are not blocked by the object continue in a straight line to the screen, forming a lit area. The area behind the object where light is blocked is the shadow.",
    "5. **Distance Effects:** ",
    "   - Increasing `object_distance_from_light` moves the object further from the light source, potentially changing shadow size and sharpness.",
    "   - Increasing `screen_distance_from_object` moves the screen further from the object, which will enlarge the shadow if the object is opaque.",
    "6. **Intensity Effect:** Increasing `light_source_intensity` makes the lit areas brighter and can make shadows appear darker by contrast.",
    "7. **Pin-Hole Camera Logic (Separate View/Mode):**",
    "   - User selects an object and a light source.",
    "   - A small 'pin-hole' aperture is shown.",
    "   - Only rays passing through the pin-hole reach the screen inside the camera.",
    "   - Due to straight-line travel, an inverted image of the object is formed on the screen inside.",
    "8. **Visual Updates:** All visual elements (light rays, shadow shape/intensity, image in pin-hole camera) update dynamically as simulation variables change."
