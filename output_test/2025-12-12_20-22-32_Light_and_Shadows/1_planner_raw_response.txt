    "Light travels in straight lines.",

    "Initialize scene with a light source on the left, an object in the center, and a screen on the right.",
    "When 'Shadow Mode' is active, display light rays as straight lines from the source to the object.",
    "If object is opaque, block all rays behind it to form a sharp shadow on the screen.",
    "If object is transparent, allow rays to pass through unchanged; no shadow forms.",
    "If object is translucent, allow dimmed, scattered rays to pass; show a faint shadow.",
    "When sliders change light position, update shadow size and sharpness in real-time.",
    "In 'Pin-Hole Camera Mode', replace the object with a box containing a small pin-hole.",
    "Show light rays from a virtual object passing through the pin-hole to form an inverted image on the inner screen.",
    "Ensure all ray paths remain straight lines throughout the simulation."
