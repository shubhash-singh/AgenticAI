  "followups": [
    "Try making shadow puppets with your hands using a flashlight!",
    "Experiment with different objects at home - see which ones make clear shadows and which don't."
  ],
  "summary": "Light travels in straight lines. When it hits an opaque object, it creates a shadow because the object blocks the light. Transparent objects let all light through, while translucent objects let some light through but scatter it. This is why we can see through glass but not through wood, and why shadows help us tell time with sundials!"
