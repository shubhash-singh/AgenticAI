  "text_instructions_for_students": "Hi there! Let's learn about how heat moves. Heat always flows from a hotter object to a colder object, just like water flows downhill. This movement is called the 'flow of heat'. In this simulation, you can set the initial temperatures of two objects. Press 'Start Simulation' to watch heat travel from the warmer object to the cooler one. See how their temperatures change until they become the same! Remember, temperature measures how hot or cold something is, while heat is the energy that moves because of this difference. Try to answer these: 1. If you put a hot spoon in cold water, which way does the heat flow? 2. What happens when the temperatures of both objects are the same?",
