  "followups": [
    "Great job observing how heat moves! This principle of heat flowing from hot to cold is super important.",
    "Remember, heat is a form of energy, and it always seeks to spread out from where it's concentrated to where it's less concentrated."
  ],
  "summary": "Heat always travels from a hotter object to a colder object until they reach the same temperature."
