    {
      "question": "Imagine you have a hot cup of cocoa and a cold glass of juice. Which way will heat prefer to move?",
      "type": "prediction",
      "options": [
        "Heat will move from the cocoa to the juice.",
        "Heat will move from the juice to the cocoa.",
        "Heat won't move because they are both liquids.",
        "Heat will move equally in both directions."
      ],
      "hint": "Think about what feels hotter and what feels colder. Heat naturally goes from where there's more of it to where there's less of it.",

      "question": "When you touch a hot stove, what is happening to the heat energy?",
      "type": "prediction",
      "options": [
        "Heat is flowing from the stove to your hand.",
        "Heat is flowing from your hand to the stove.",
        "No heat is flowing because your hand isn't that hot.",
        "Heat is being created by your touch."
      ],
      "hint": "Remember the rule: heat always travels from a hotter object to a colder object. Which one is hotter in this case?",

    {
      "question": "If you put a cold metal spoon into a hot bowl of soup, what will happen to the spoon?",
      "type": "prediction",
      "options": [
        "The spoon will get colder.",
        "The spoon will get warmer.",
        "The spoon will stay the same temperature.",
        "The soup will get colder and the spoon will get hotter."
      ],
      "hint": "Think about the direction heat travels when there's a temperature difference. The soup is hotter than the spoon.",

    "Great job understanding how heat moves! It's all about that journey from hot to cold.",
    "Remember, this 'flow of heat' is a super important idea in science!"
