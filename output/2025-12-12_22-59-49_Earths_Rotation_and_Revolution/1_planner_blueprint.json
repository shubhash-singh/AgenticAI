  "simulation_logic": [
    "Initialize Earth at a starting position in orbit with correct axial tilt",
    "Update Earth's rotation based on the rotation slider, showing day/night transition on the globe",
    "Update Earth's orbital position based on the revolution slider, changing the hemisphere tilted toward the Sun",

  "misconceptions_to_address": [
    "Seasons are caused by Earth's distance from the Sun (not true - it's the tilt)",
    "Day and night are caused by the Sun moving around Earth (not true - it's Earth's rotation)",
    "The Earth's orbit is a perfect circle (it's elliptical but nearly circular)",
    "Both hemispheres experience the same season simultaneously (they experience opposite seasons)"
  ],
  "text_instructions_for_students": "Welcome to the Earth's Rotation and Revolution simulation! Use the sliders to see how Earth spins on its axis (rotation) and moves around the Sun (revolution). Watch how these movements create day and night, and cause the seasons to change. Try the 'Toggle Tilt' button to see how Earth's tilted axis affects sunlight distribution.",
