    "Clear and engaging visual representation of thermal equilibrium and heat transfer.",
    "Scientifically accurate portrayal of heat flow and temperature change.",
    "Interactive elements (sliders, buttons) are highly responsive and provide immediate visual feedback.",
    "Code is generally well-structured and handles simulation logic effectively.",
    "Content is entirely appropriate and safe for a 7th-grade audience."

  "required_changes": [
    "Mobile Responsiveness: The SVG elements (rect, text) are not perfectly centered on smaller screens. While the `visual-area` uses flexbox to center the SVG, the SVG itself might need internal adjustments or the `visual-area`'s CSS could be refined to ensure SVG content is always perfectly centered regardless of aspect ratio or internal content. The `max-width: 400px;` on `#thermo-svg` within a `90%` width container can sometimes lead to slight off-centering depending on available screen width. Consider adjusting `justify-content` and `align-items` on `#visual-area` or using `margin: auto` on `#thermo-svg`.",
    "Mobile Responsiveness: The `reset_button` has a `min-height: 48px` but lacks sufficient padding for a 48px touch target. The current padding is `12px`, making the actual height likely around 40px (based on font-size and line-height). This needs to be increased to ensure a minimum touch target of 48px. The same applies to `toggleContact_button` if its padding doesn't bring it to 48px."
  ],
  "optional_improvements": [
    "Pedagogical Clarity: While the concept is clear, explicitly stating the learning objectives at the beginning of the simulation or in accompanying documentation would be beneficial for a formal educational setting.",
    "Interactivity Quality: The particle animations are good, but there's a slight visual lag when interactions occur rapidly or when the simulation is first starting up. Optimizing the DOM manipulation within `updateParticles` or leveraging requestAnimationFrame more efficiently might smooth this out further.",
    "Conceptual Correctness: For 7th grade, the temperature unit is implicitly Celsius. While acceptable, explicitly stating 'Celsius' in the initial setup and throughout the simulation where temperatures are displayed would remove any ambiguity, especially if the simulation were to be adapted for international audiences.",
    "Code Reliability: The `lastTime` variable is reset within `startSimulation`. While this works, resetting `lastTime = 0;` at the very beginning of `init()` and ensuring `simulateFrame` handles the first `deltaTime` correctly when `lastTime` is `0` would make the delta time calculation more robust across different states (e.g., if `startSimulation` was called multiple times without an intervening `stopSimulation`). Currently, it might recalculate delta based on when `startSimulation` was last called, not necessarily the beginning of the simulation run.",
    "Mobile Responsiveness: The spacing between the `control-group` elements is currently controlled by `margin: 16px 0;`. While the vertical spacing is adequate, consider adding horizontal padding within the `#controls` div or to individual `control-group` elements if horizontal stacking becomes an issue on very narrow screens, to prevent controls from feeling too cramped."
