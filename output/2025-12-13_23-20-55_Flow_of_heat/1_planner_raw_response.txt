    "Step 2: User adjusts 'Initial Temperature of Object A' and 'Initial Temperature of Object B' sliders. Visuals (color, text display) for respective objects update instantly. The system ensures Object A's temperature slider cannot go below Object B's, and vice versa, to maintain clear hot/cold states for simplicity (or dynamically re-designate hot/cold if temperatures cross).",
    "Step 3: When 'Thermal Contact' toggle is flipped ON:",
    "   a. A 'connection' visual (glowing wavy line in the gap) appears between the two objects.",
    "   b. Small red/orange heat particles (e.g., 5-10 particles at a time) animate, continuously flowing from the object with higher temperature to the object with lower temperature. The flow direction is determined dynamically.",
    "   c. The temperature of the hotter object gradually decreases, and the colder object's temperature gradually increases. This is reflected in their changing background colors (e.g., hot object fades from red to yellow, cold object shifts from blue to green/yellow) and digital displays.",
    "   d. The speed and quantity of heat particles flowing visually decrease as the temperature difference between objects lessens, simulating slower heat transfer.",
    "   e. The simulation continues until both objects reach a similar temperature (within 1-2°C for thermal equilibrium). At this point, particle flow stops, the connection line fades away, object colors stabilize to an intermediate color, and the info text updates to 'Thermal Equilibrium reached'.",
    "Step 4: When 'Thermal Contact' toggle is flipped OFF:",
    "   a. Particle flow immediately stops, and the connection line disappears.",
    "   b. Object temperatures reset instantly to the values set by their respective initial temperature sliders.",
    "   c. The 'info' text updates to 'Not connected' or 'Ready to connect'."
