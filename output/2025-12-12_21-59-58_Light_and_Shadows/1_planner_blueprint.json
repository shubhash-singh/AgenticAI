    "Light travels in straight lines",
    "Opaque objects block light completely",

    "Slider to adjust light source angle (0° to 180°)",

  "simulation_logic": [
    "Initialize scene with light source, object, and screen in vertical layout",
    "Display light rays as straight lines from source to object",
    "For opaque objects: show complete shadow region behind object where no light reaches",
    "For transparent objects: show light rays passing straight through with no shadow",
    "For translucent objects: show scattered light rays and faint shadow",
    "In pinhole camera mode: replace object with pinhole and show inverted image formation on screen",
    "Update shadow size and sharpness based on light source position and object distance",
    "Provide instant visual feedback for all user interactions"
