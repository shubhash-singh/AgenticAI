  "strengths": [
    "The visual representation of Earth's orbit and axial tilt is excellent and highly intuitive.",
    "The simulation demonstrates scientific accuracy regarding orbital mechanics and the cause of seasons.",
    "Controls are generally responsive, and the interactivity for manipulating tilt, speed, and rotation is good.",
    "The explanation of seasons, while simplified, is appropriate for a 7th-grade level.",
    "The code is well-structured with clear variable names and functions."
  ],
  "required_changes": [
    "Mobile Responsiveness: On smaller screens (e.g., 360px width), the SVG graphic ('solar-system-svg') seems to have a fixed max-width of 600px which causes horizontal overflow if the parent container is narrower. The SVG should better adapt to smaller container widths or the container itself needs better responsive scaling. Adjustments are needed to prevent horizontal scrolling and ensure all content is visible without manual panning. The 'app' div has padding, but the SVG within it needs better sizing. Consider making the SVG's max-width relative or using CSS transforms for scaling.",
    "Mobile Responsiveness: The 'button' elements have a `min-height: 48px` which is good, but the 'resetButton' and 'playPauseButton' have a flex ratio that might make them smaller than 48px in certain layouts on mobile, and their touch targets might be less than ideal. Ensure all buttons have a minimum width and height of 48px, and their labels are clearly legible.",
    "Interactivity Quality: While responsiveness is good, the immediate visual update for slider changes (like axial tilt) is present, but the 'playPauseButton' text update happens after the toggle. For a more seamless UX, the button text could be updated before the state change is fully processed or immediately after. This is a minor UX refinement.",
    "Code Reliability: The `updateVisuals` function has a `try...catch` block, which is good. However, if an error occurs, it's logged to the console but the animation continues. While not critical for this simulation, for more complex applications, consider a more robust error handling strategy to prevent unexpected states. Also, consider adding a check to ensure `animationFrameId` is null or undefined before calling `cancelAnimationFrame` to prevent potential race conditions."
  ],
  "optional_improvements": [
    "Pedagogical Clarity: While the concept is well-explained, consider adding a brief introductory text or tooltip to explain what each slider and button controls before the user interacts with them.",
    "Pedagogical Clarity: The 'subtitle' font size (14px) is acceptable, but on some mobile devices, the main headings ('h1' at 24px) might become slightly too large, potentially pushing content down significantly. A media query for smaller screens could adjust heading sizes.",
    "Interactivity Quality: The animation for the orbit and spin is smooth. Consider adding a subtle animation or transition for the axial tilt change itself, not just the resulting visual changes.",
    "Conceptual Correctness: The 'season' calculation is a good approximation. For true accuracy in a more advanced simulation, factors like Earth's orbital eccentricity could be mentioned or simplified with a note that the current model assumes a circular orbit for educational purposes."
