      "options": [
        "Heat will flow from the cocoa to the water.",
        "Heat will flow from the water to the cocoa.",
        "Heat will not flow at all.",
        "Heat will flow equally in both directions."

    {
      "question": "If object1 is at 70\u00b0C and object2 is at 20\u00b0C, what will happen to their temperatures over time if they are in contact?",
      "type": "mcq",
      "options": [
        "Object1's temperature will increase and object2's temperature will decrease.",
        "Object1's temperature will decrease and object2's temperature will increase.",
        "Both temperatures will stay the same.",
        "Both temperatures will decrease."

      "hint": "Heat moves from the hotter object to the colder object. What effect does this have on their temperatures?",

    {
      "question": "When heat flows from object1 to object2 until they are the same temperature, what is this state called?",
      "type": "mcq",
      "options": [
        "Thermal Equilibrium",
        "Heat Transfer",
        "Temperature Difference",
        "Energy Flow"

  "followups": [
    "Great job exploring heat flow! You saw how heat naturally moves from hotter to colder things, like our warm cocoa cooling down and the water warming up.",
    "This movement of heat is super important in so many things around us, from cooking our food to how our planet stays warm!"
  ],
  "summary": "Heat energy always flows from a hotter object to a colder object until they reach thermal equilibrium, meaning they are the same temperature."
