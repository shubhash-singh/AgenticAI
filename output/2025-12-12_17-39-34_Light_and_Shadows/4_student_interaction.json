  "summary": "Light travels in straight lines. When an opaque object blocks this path, a shadow is formed behind it. Objects can be transparent (light passes through), translucent (some light passes through), or opaque (no light passes through). A pin-hole camera uses light traveling in straight lines to create an image."
