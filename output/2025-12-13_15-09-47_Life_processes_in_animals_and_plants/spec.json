  "Description": "Life processes are the essential activities that living things, like animals and plants, do to survive and keep going. These processes help them get food, breathe, grow, and get rid of waste.",

    "Nutrition in Plants (Autotrophic, Heterotrophic)",
    "Nutrition in Animals (Ingestion, Digestion, Absorption, Assimilation, Egestion)",

  "Detail": "Living things need certain basic processes to stay alive. These are called life processes.\n* **Nutrition:** This is how living things get their food. Plants make their own food (autotrophs), while animals have to eat other things (heterotrophs).\n* **Respiration:** This is how living things get energy from food. They take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide.\n* **Transportation:** This is about moving useful things like food and oxygen to all parts of the body, and waste products away.\n* **Excretion:** This is the process of getting rid of waste materials from the body.",

    "In Plants": [
      "**Nutrition:** Plants use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to make their own food through photosynthesis.",
      "**Respiration:** Plants breathe in oxygen and release carbon dioxide (like us!) to get energy from their food.",
      "**Transportation:** Plants have special tubes called xylem to carry water and minerals from the roots to the leaves, and phloem to carry food from leaves to other parts.",
      "**Excretion:** Plants get rid of waste by losing leaves or storing them in parts like bark."
    ],
    "In Animals": [
      "**Nutrition:** Animals take in food (ingestion), break it down (digestion), use it (absorption and assimilation), and get rid of leftover waste (egestion).",
      "**Respiration:** Animals breathe in oxygen to get energy from the food they eat.",
      "**Transportation:** Animals have blood that carries oxygen, food, and other essential substances to all parts of the body. The heart pumps this blood.",
      "**Excretion:** Animals remove waste products like urea and sweat from their body."

  "Intuition_Logical_Flow": "Think of a living thing as a small factory. This factory needs:\n1. **Raw Materials:** Food (nutrition)\n2. **Power Source:** Energy from food (respiration)\n3. **Delivery System:** To send ingredients and finished goods around (transportation)\n4. **Waste Removal:** To clear out the trash (excretion)\n\nAll these steps are important for the factory (living organism) to work properly and stay \"open\" for business (alive).",

  "Real-Life_Applications": [
    "**Farming:** Understanding plant nutrition and photosynthesis helps farmers grow better crops.",
    "**Human Health:** Knowing how digestion and excretion work helps us understand the importance of a balanced diet and hygiene.",
    "**Ecosystems:** The interdependence of plants (producers) and animals (consumers) in terms of nutrition shows how life processes are linked in nature."
  ],
  "Relation_Between_Sub-Concepts": "All the life processes are interconnected. For example:\n* **Nutrition** provides the food that is broken down during **respiration** to release energy.\n* **Transportation** is needed to move nutrients from where they are absorbed (during nutrition) to all cells for **respiration**, and to move waste products for **excretion**.\n* **Excretion** removes waste products that are formed as a result of **nutrition** and **respiration**.",
