  "strengths": [
    "Clear learning objective: understanding heat flow.",
    "Information is presented at an appropriate 7th-grade level.",
    "Instructions are concise and easy to follow.",
    "Visual representation of heat flow with color changes and particles is effective.",
    "The simulation accurately models heat transfer between two objects.",
    "No scientific inaccuracies or misconceptions introduced.",
    "Code is clean, well-structured, and free of JavaScript errors.",
    "Interactive elements provide immediate visual feedback.",
    "Content is safe, age-appropriate, and suitable for the target audience."
  ],
  "required_changes": [
    "Mobile Responsiveness: The main SVG graphic is not perfectly centered on smaller screens, leading to potential off-center viewing. Ensure `max-width: 400px` for `#simulation_svg` is respected and that it's centered within `#visual-area` using flexbox properties for consistent alignment across devices.",
    "Mobile Responsiveness: While the buttons have a `min-height`, the `Start Heat Flow` button's padding might result in a touch target slightly smaller than 48px on some devices. Adjust padding or add additional margin to ensure it meets the 48px minimum."
  ],
  "optional_improvements": [
    "Consider adding a subtle animation or visual cue when the simulation reaches thermal equilibrium, beyond just text.",
    "The 'arbitrary units' terminology is fine, but could be further elaborated with a brief note if desired, though not strictly necessary for this age group."
