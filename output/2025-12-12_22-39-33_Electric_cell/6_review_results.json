    "Fix conceptual error: Current flow animation shows particles moving from negative to positive, but the animation path is incorrect - particles should flow through the complete circuit path, not just appear at one point",

    "Add proper current flow visualization: Current should flow along the wire paths, not just appear as floating particles"
