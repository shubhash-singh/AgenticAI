  "main_display": "A simplified 2D animation of a simple pendulum, featuring a fixed pivot point (small circle), a string (thin line) hanging from it, and a bob (solid circle) at the end. The bob swings in a smooth, arc-like motion. An invisible timer overlay counts time.",

    "#E74C3C",
    "#F8F8F8",

  "animation_style": "smooth, continuous arc motion for the pendulum. A subtle highlight (e.g., a momentary change in bob color or a small 'tick' animation) indicates the completion of one full oscillation.",
  "visual_metaphor": "A child on a swing set. The time it takes to go back and forth once is like one 'tick' of our pendulum clock."
