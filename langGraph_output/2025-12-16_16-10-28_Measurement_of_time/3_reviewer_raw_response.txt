    "The simulation accurately implements all planned features from the blueprint.",

    "The physics of the pendulum and its relationship to time are conceptually correct.",
    "The animation is smooth and the interactivity is generally good, with immediate feedback.",
    "The code is well-structured and free of JavaScript errors."

  "required_changes": [
    "Improve mobile responsiveness: While the viewport meta tag is present, the simulation's layout may not be optimal on very small screens. Test on a 360px width device to ensure no horizontal scrolling occurs and all elements remain centered and functional. Ensure touch targets for buttons are at least 48px height. The current button height is 48px, which meets the requirement.",
    "Enhance pedagogical clarity: While the concept is explained, a brief introductory sentence within the 'info' section or in the header explaining *why* pendulum length affects time would further solidify the learning objective for Class 7. For example, adding: 'A longer pendulum swings slower, taking more time for each back-and-forth motion.'"
