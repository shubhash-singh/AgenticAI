    "Mobile Responsiveness: Button elements within `.button-group` have a `min-height` of 48px, which meets the touch target requirement. However, their `min-width` is 120px, and they can wrap, leading to potentially smaller touch areas when fewer buttons are on a line. Consider ensuring consistent 48x48 minimum touch target across all button configurations.",
    "Mobile Responsiveness: On a 360px width screen, the controls panel can become a bit cramped, and the text size in the `#info` div may be slightly too large, leading to minor content overlap or the need for horizontal scrolling in some cases if the content were longer. While not severe, further minor adjustments to padding or font sizes within the `#controls` and `#info` sections might improve the experience.",
    "Mobile Responsiveness: The SVG elements themselves scale well due to `max-width` and `max-height` properties, but ensuring the overall layout of `#app` maintains adequate spacing and readability on very narrow screens would be beneficial."
