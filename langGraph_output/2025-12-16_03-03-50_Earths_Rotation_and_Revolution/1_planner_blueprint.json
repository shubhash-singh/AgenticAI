  "main_display": "A central, static, bright yellow/orange Sun sphere. An orbiting blue/green Earth sphere will show a distinct illuminated (day) and shadowed (night) side. A dashed white line will represent Earth's tilted axis, visually passing through the North and South Poles. A faint elliptical grey line will depict the Earth's orbital path around the Sun. Dynamic text labels for 'Day'/'Night' and 'Season' (e.g., 'Summer N. Hemisphere') will appear adjacent to the Earth sphere.",
