    "1. Initialize: Render the Sun centrally. Place the Earth at its starting orbital position with a default 23.5-degree axial tilt. Set both Rotation Speed and Revolution Speed to 50%. Display initial 'Day' and 'Spring' for the Northern Hemisphere.",
    "2. Rotation Loop: Continuously rotate the Earth sphere on its axis (360 degrees) at a speed determined by 'Rotation Speed'. Update the illuminated and shadowed regions on Earth to visibly simulate the day and night cycle. Update the 'day-night-status' text as appropriate.",
    "3. Revolution Loop: Continuously move the Earth sphere along its elliptical orbit around the Sun at a speed determined by 'Revolution Speed'.",
    "4. Axial Tilt Update: When the 'Axial Tilt Angle' slider is adjusted, smoothly animate the visual tilt of the Earth's axis (over ~100ms). The tilt must remain constant in direction relative to space as Earth revolves. This change dynamically affects which hemisphere receives more direct sunlight.",
    "5. Season Determination: Based on the Earth's current position in its orbit and the 'Axial Tilt Angle', dynamically update the 'season-status' text. For example, when the Northern Hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun, display 'Summer N. Hemisphere'.",
    "6. Interactive Feedback: All slider adjustments must result in immediate visual feedback (<100ms) on the corresponding movement (Earth's spin rate, orbital speed, or axis angle) and status updates."
