    "All planned variables are implemented and function as described in the blueprint.",
    "The visual design closely matches the blueprint's description, including the Sun, Earth, orbital path, axis line, and text labels.",
    "The simulation logic for rotation, revolution, and axial tilt is scientifically sound and supports the learning objectives.",
    "The color scheme adheres to the specified blueprint colors.",
    "The animation is smooth and continuous as planned.",
    "The visual metaphor is implicitly supported by the simulation's mechanics.",
    "The learning objectives related to day/night and seasons are achievable.",
    "The simulation correctly represents Earth's spin, tilt, and revolution.",
    "Appropriate simplifications are made for an educational context, and no apparent misconceptions are introduced.",
    "Terminology used in the info section is appropriate.",
    "Controls respond immediately, and visual feedback is provided through updated text and SVG elements.",
    "No JavaScript errors were detected during testing.",
    "Event handling and code structure are clean and self-contained."

    "Mobile Responsiveness: The slider input elements (`<input type='range'>`) have a `min-height: 48px;` in the CSS, which is good. However, the `label` elements are not consistently providing a 48px touch target. For example, the 'Rotation Speed' label and its value span are inline and might not offer sufficient touch area on their own. Consider wrapping the entire control group in a more clickable element or ensuring the label itself has adequate padding/height for touch interaction.",
    "Mobile Responsiveness: On a 360px width, the `max-width: 600px;` on `#app` and `max-width: 400px;` on the SVG are generally good. However, the text inside the header (`h1` and `p`) might become cramped on very narrow screens without additional media queries for font-size adjustments. The `padding: 0 8px;` on the subtitle is helpful but could be insufficient on the smallest screens.",
    "Mobile Responsiveness: While the simulation itself is responsive, the `line-height: 1.6;` might lead to very tall text blocks on mobile, potentially pushing content down excessively. Adjustments for smaller screens might be beneficial."
