    "Step 4: Animate 'heat particles' flowing between objects (e.g., small orange dots moving along a path). The speed of these particles and the rate of temperature equalization are controlled by the 'Flow Speed' slider.",
    "Step 5: Continuously update the internal temperatures of Object A (decreasing if hotter, increasing if colder) and Object B (vice-versa) at a rate proportional to the temperature difference and 'Flow Speed'. Update displayed current temperatures above objects.",
    "Step 6: Objects' colors and internal particle activity dynamically adjust based on their *current* temperature during the flow.",
    "Step 7: When the temperatures of Object A and Object B become approximately equal (e.g., within 0.5°C), the particle flow animation stops, and the status text updates to 'Thermal Equilibrium Reached'. The 'Start/Pause' button automatically changes to 'Reset'.",
