    "On mobile devices, the buttons have a height of 48px, but their padding might cause them to appear slightly smaller on certain screens. Consider adding `min-height: 48px;` to the button style for a more consistent touch target size across devices, although `min-height: 48px;` is already applied.",
    "The `button` elements have `min-height: 48px;` which is good for touch targets. However, they do not explicitly have a `min-width`. While they flex, ensuring they maintain a usable width on smaller screens would be beneficial. This is more of a suggestion for further enhancement rather than a strict requirement, as the flex behavior generally handles it well. The current implementation is acceptable for the target age group.",
    "The SVG `viewBox` and `width`/`height` attributes ensure responsiveness, but the overall `max-width` of the simulation container (`#app`) can limit the display on larger screens. For mobile responsiveness, the `max-width` of `#app` should be removed or increased significantly to allow the content to scale up.",
    "The text elements within the SVG (`#temp-a-display`, `#temp-b-display`) do not scale with the SVG itself if the SVG scales beyond its original `viewBox` dimensions. This might lead to text that is too large or too small relative to the objects on different screen sizes. Consider using `text` elements within a responsive container or adjusting their sizes dynamically if needed, although for Class 7, the current approach is likely sufficient."
