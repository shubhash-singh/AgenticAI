  "first_impressions": [
    "It's immediately clear this simulation is about heat flow between objects.",
    "The visual setup with a hot and cold object separated by an environment is intuitive."
  ],
  "visual": [
    "The SVG elements are generally clear and well-defined, making it easy to distinguish the hot object, cold object, and the environment.",
    "The color gradient for the temperature gauges could be a little smoother, as there are noticeable steps."
  ],
  "controls": [
    "The sliders are easy to drag and manipulate on my phone with good touch targets.",
    "The labels for the sliders ('Hot Object Temperature', 'Cold Object Temperature') are clear and understandable."
  ],
  "explanations": [
    "The 'Key Concepts' section provides clear and concise explanations that are helpful for understanding the underlying physics.",
    "There was no confusion; the explanations directly supported what was happening in the simulation."
  ],
  "bugs_or_issues": [
    "The particles sometimes get stuck at the edges of the hot and cold rectangles instead of bouncing off smoothly."
  ],
  "suggestions": [
    "Adding a visual representation of individual particles moving would greatly enhance the simulation's didactic value.",
    "The draggable separator should ideally be constrained to move only within the bounds of the environment rectangle."
